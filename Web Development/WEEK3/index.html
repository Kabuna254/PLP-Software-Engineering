            I am a dedicated and ambitious individual currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas. My passion for data-driven decision-making and AI-driven solutions drives my academic journey, where I aim to bridge the gap between technology and business insights. With a strong background in analytics, I am continuously honing my skills to excel in this field. To support my education, I have secured an education loan from MPOWER, supplemented by a sponsor. As I prepare for my F1 visa interview, I am focused on articulating my professional experience and how it aligns with my academic goals. My determination, strategic planning, and problem-solving mindset keep me motivated as I work toward a successful career in business analytics and AI.
