            <p>
                I am proficient in several programming languages, each enabling me to work across various 
                domains of web development, data analysis, and database management. I have a strong foundation in 
                <span class="icon">&#60;&#47;&#62;</span>HTML and <span class="icon">&#x1F4C4;</span>CSS,
                which allows me to build and style responsive and user-friendly websites. I am also skilled in üêçPython, 
                a versatile language used for a wide range of applications from web development to data science. My experience 
                with <span class="icon">&#128218;</span>MySQL ensures I can efficiently manage databases and perform complex queries. 
                Additionally, 
                I am knowledgeable in <span class="icon">&#x1F4C8;</span>R, particularly for data analysis and statistical computing. Finally, 
                I have hands-on experience with ‚òïJavaScript, which I use to add interactivity and dynamic features to web applications.

            <p> I'm passionate about technology, always curious about how things work and how I can build something new. 
                I love coding and exploring AI, but I also enjoy the creative side of things‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs designing a website, 
                analyzing data trends, or brainstorming innovative ideas. Outside of tech, I‚Äôm into pool billiards, swimming, music, and 
                participating in outdoor activities. I like a good challenge, whether it's solving a tough problem or competing 
                in a hackathon. Learning and growing through new experiences keeps me motivated every day.

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>
                    <h4>Building a Calculator</h4>
                    I built a simple calculator as a project to demonstrate my understanding of core programming
                    concepts like functions, conditionals, and loops. I applied HTML and CSS for the user interface. 
                    This project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and gave me hands-on experience with front-end
                    development, making the calculator not just a functional tool but also a way to showcase my ability to 
                    create interactive, user-friendly web applications.<br>
                    Here's a link to my project: <a href="https://github.com/Kabuna254/PLP-Software-Engineering/blob/main/Python/WEEK%201/calculator.py"><b>Calculator</b></a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Second Project -->
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p> I created a grade-assigning system that takes test scores and assigns letter grades based on thresholds
                    using Python. The system is interactive and easy to use. 
                    This project helped me apply conditionals, improve problem-solving skills, and create a practical tool 
                    for grading.
