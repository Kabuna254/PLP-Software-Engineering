# Example of a while loop
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1  # Increment the counter

# Initialization: count = 1 sets the starting value.
# Condition: while count <= 5 keeps the loop running as long as count is less than or equal to 5.
# Action: Inside the loop:
# It prints the current value of count.
# The count the variable is incremented by 1 (count += 1) to eventually meet the exit condition.
