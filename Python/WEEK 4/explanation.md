Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each line in the code:

1. def main():
This defines the main() function, which is the entry point of the program. It contains the logic that will be executed when the script runs.

2. try:
This starts a try block that allows us to catch exceptions (errors) during the execution of the program. If any error occurs within this block, it will be handled by the corresponding except blocks.

3. inputfile = input("Enter the name of the file to read from: ")
This line prompts the user to enter the name of the file they want to read from. The input provided by the user is stored in the variable inputfile.

4. try:
This starts a nested try block. This one will handle the specific actions for reading the file (the inputfile the user entered).

5. with open(r'Python\WEEK 4\inputfile', 'r') as file:
This line opens the file that the user specified. The file path is r'Python\WEEK 4\inputfile', where r makes it a raw string (so backslashes are treated correctly). The 'r' argument indicates that the file is opened for reading.

The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block is exited, whether the operation is successful or an exception is raised.

6. content = file.read()
This reads the entire content of the file and stores it in the variable content.

7. print("\nFile read successfully!")
This prints a success message to the console indicating that the file was read successfully.

8. except FileNotFoundError:
This catches the FileNotFoundError exception, which occurs if the file the user specified doesn't exist at the given path.

9. print(f"Error: The file '{inputfile}' was not found. Please check the filename and try again.")
If the file is not found, this line prints an error message, including the filename that was entered.

10. return
This ends the function if the file is not found, preventing further execution.

11. except IOError:
This catches any IOError exceptions that may arise when trying to open or read the file. An IOError can occur if there are issues accessing the file (permissions, other IO issues).

12. print(f"Error: Could not read the file '{inputfile}'. Check if the file is accessible.")
If there is an IOError, this prints a message notifying the user that there was an issue reading the file.

13. return
This exits the function if an IOError is raised, preventing further execution.

14. modified = content.upper()
This line modifies the content of the file by converting all text to uppercase using Python's upper() method. The modified text is stored in the modified variable.

15. outputfile = input("Enter the name of the new file to write to: ")
This line asks the user to enter the name of the output file where the modified content should be saved. The file name is stored in the outputfile variable.

16. try:
This starts another try block for writing to the output file, which ensures that errors in writing are handled separately.

17. with open(r'Python\WEEK 4\outputfile', 'w') as file:
This opens the specified output file for writing ('w' mode). If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

Again, the with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed after the operation.

18. file.write(modified)
This writes the modified content (in uppercase) into the file.

19. print(f"\nModified content written to '{outputfile}' successfully.")
This prints a success message indicating that the modified content was successfully written to the output file.

20. except IOError:
This handles any IOError exceptions that may occur while trying to write to the output file. For example, it could occur if there are permission issues or other IO problems while writing the file.

21. print(f"Error: Could not write to the file '{outputfile}'. Please check the file path and try again.")
If there is an IOError, this prints a message notifying the user that the file could not be written.

22. except Exception as e:
This is a general exception handler that catches any other unforeseen errors (i.e., those that are not FileNotFoundError or IOError). The error is stored in the variable e.

23. print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
This prints the unexpected error message if any other exception is caught, along with the exception details.

24. if __name__ == "__main__":
This line checks if the script is being run as the main program. If the script is imported into another module, this block will not run.

25. main()
This calls the main() function to execute the program when the script is run.
